    paragraphs:
      - text: "So this is the question for today: what is the New Weapon? It is a two-fold question: what new weapon governs us? and what new weapon do we have to protect ourselves? We’ve been discussing the first part of this question concerning the existing and emerging technologies and techniques of control. But I’d like to turn now to how we might subvert these technologies. How can we use the tools of surveillance to subvert the power structure? Two approaches come to mind: counter-surveillance and obfuscation. Counter-surveillance is appropriating the technology of surveillance to empower individuals and protect their privacy. For example, Steve Mann created <a href='http://wearcam.org/' target='_blank'>wearable devices</a> that are designed to conceal individual’s identity and can also be used to stare back at the surveillance camera. Surya Mattu created <a href='https://github.com/samatt/NSHey' target='_blank'>NSHEYYY</a> which sniffs out the wireless network of nearby devices, and makes private information about the device (such as its history of logging into certain wireless networks) available and visible. NSHEYYY uses the same protocols that are used by the wireless providers and advertising companies, but instead of exploiting data for profit, it makes the data available for its users. Another approach is obfuscation in which so much data is intentionally given to the point that the data becomes meaningless. <a href='https://adnauseam.io'>Adnaseum</a> is a web browser extension that tricks google chrome to think the user is clicking all the advertisements. It’s “a free browser extension designed to obfuscate browsing data and protect users from tracking by advertising networks.”<span class='citation-num'>9</span> Projects like these make it possible for someone like us to have an active engagement with technology as opposed to merely being subject to it."

  - title: "Discussion"
    paragraphs:  
      - text: 'Francis: With projects like NSHEYYY that are both critiques and tools at the same time, it seems like they succeed in showing people what they can do but at the same time they also empower people to potentially do some pretty creepy things. For example: a program that lets you log into someone’s Facebook if they were on public wifi on the same network as you. These projects point out flaws in our system, but at the same time, they are also ethically complicated because they allow people to do some bad stuff.'

      - text: 'Taeyoon: Definitely. I think artists like Surya Mattu know counter-surveillance is not a total solution, but in pointing to issues that are not talked about, it is a step forward. And I believe these kinds of interventions do lead us to be better informed about the conditions we live in. I think this is a good time to think about Artificial Intelligence (AI). I don’t actually understand AI enough to tell how it is different from stored program computers and if it is just indexical challenges or if AI actually shifts the paradigm because human agencies are displaced. However, we know the new weapons of mass destruction, such as drones, on a fundamental level share the same logic of Machine Learning algorithms as the tools for marketing and mass consumerism. What is your thought on that?'

      - text: 'Francis: I think of a few things. I guess one of the most interesting things about AI is in relation to conventional surveillance mechanisms. Because it’s against the Constitution for a cop to just stop you and look through your stuff, people are trying to figure out the implications of AI for mass surveillance. I think the current precedent is that AI can collect as much data on you as it can, and it doesn’t count as illegal search and seizure until a human looks at it. It’s interesting that the relationship we have with AI is increasingly one of anthropomorphization, where we regard it as human. It makes me wonder if AI will ever cross a threshold where it has become so sophisticated at pattern recognition that it’s like a human is looking at your data and if the Fourth Amendment would kick in there. But on the other hand, if you have a human surveilling you, then theoretically you could negotiate with that person, reason with them, tell them to go away. Maybe you can’t negotiate with an AI.'   


      - text: 'Taeyoon: And connecting that to the day-to-day level, there are discussions about self-driving cars and what would happen if they are involved in an accident. It would just introduce another level of entanglement that we don’t have the policy for.'
      - text: 'Student 1: Self-driving cars, although I can’t wait for them to come, are tied to the idea of ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_superhighway" target="_blank">superhighways</a>’. We’ll have increasingly rapid ways to get to a place but we’re only going on this one highway that’ll be controlled. So our self-driving cars might only take us through places that have shopping malls or to other calculated destinations, and we won’t get off the beaten path.'

      - text: "Student 2: When these conversations arise, I think about how we live our lives in the constant, vast systems of surveillance and control that really dictate what we can do and are monitoring us all the time. But once they are in place it’s really hard to make them go away, right? Like once the infrastructure of PRISM is in place, it’s very hard to say, oh let’s just shut it all down. I feel like it is more of a question of whether it’s possible to backtrack or deconstruct these things."

      - text: "Francis: One project that I’d connect that to is Project Cybersyn. Salvador Allende, a democratically elected Socialist president in Chile in the 60s, started Cybersyn in a bid to create a cybernetically planned economy. And this was back when Chile literally had five computers, and IBM refused to sell them stuff because they were afraid Allende would nationalize their company. But this cybernetic network, created to manage the economy democratically, would actually rely on infrastructure that some might view as part of mass surveillance. So that’s one possible route for trying to leverage these technologies in a more progressive direction, but it’s obviously fraught with issues."

      - text: "I also think of the “Reconfiguration Thesis,” something similar to what is discussed in logistics and supply chain management. For example, Walmart, Amazon and all these large corporations have very sophisticated ways of managing raw materials flows, production and restocking. The reconfiguration thesis for our context asks if can we take these technologies that are geared toward this globalized capitalist production and use it towards socially progressive ends. So, yeah, I think we can ask a similar question about whether surveillance infrastructure can be used in a different way."

  - title: "End note"
    paragraphs:
      - text: 'Pressing issues around human rights affirm that brick and mortar activism is still very important. However, the way we experience the world is changing, mediated through technologies of control. Considering the new normals, what should be our top priority as we create the alternatives? How can we subvert the technologies of control to empower ourselves? How can we learn about the true nature of technology, demystify the power structure and provide an alternative? And what is the takeaway from Deleuze’s “Postscript on the Societies of Control”? I return to Galloway for suggestions.'
      - text: '<span class="blockquote">The ultimate significance of control society is not so much the continuous encroachment of the border checkpoint or the passport control, not so much data mining or facial recognition algorithms, but that it has eviscerated history, not by banning dissent but by accelerating the opportunities and channels for critical thought to infinity and therefore making it impossible to think historically in the first place. Thus the central challenge within control society will be not simply to resist the various new nefarious control apparatuses, but to rescue history from its own consummation.<span class="citation-num">10</span></span>'

      - text: 'Perhaps we can begin by registering the many realities in existence, from virtual, augmented to parallel ones, some more real than the others. Perhaps we can find common ground between these realities in order to situate ourselves in a critically informed vision of history and the future.'
      - text: 'In this oscillation of realities, there may be an opportunity to connect with the past and “rescue history” as Galloway suggests. In this turn to active life, perhaps we can create the spaces for unmonitored everyday life. As artists and critical makers, we can avoid replicating the systems of control in an artwork, and instead, reveal the complexities within in it. Instead of celebrating possible uses of technology, we can ask: what is the world we want to live in?'
