    paragraphs:
      - text: "We have people like Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google and Alphanet Inc., saying on CNBC that privacy isn’t that important if you have nothing to hide."
      - text: "<span class='blockquote'>  If you have something that you don’t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn’t be doing it in the first place. But if you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines including Google do retain this information for some time, and it’s important, for example, that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act. It is possible that that information could be made available to the authorities. </span>"

      - text: "This troubling for two reasons. His statement “you shouldn’t be doing it in the first place” is a very unfair way of approaching the situation. What if you didn’t know your activity was illegal in the first place? Or what if your activity was legal at the time of execution, but the laws changed after the fact? What if it’s simply something personal or intimate that is no one else’s business? "
      - text: "Schmidt also talks about the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act' target='_blank'>USA Patriot Act</a>, enacted after September 11 attacks, which required companies to share their customers’ data with the U.S. government in case of a terrorist threat. In addition to this far-ranging legislation, there were many other secretive measures taken by the intelligence community to access private data (for instance, the President’s <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_Surveillance_Program' target='_blank'> Surveillance Program</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)' target='_blank'>PRISM</a>). We know about these surveillance activities because of Edward Snowden, a former employee of CIA who released classified information about the U.S. government’s activities. When asked about his reason for the leak in an interview, he said “<a href='https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-why' target='_blank'>I don’t want to live in a society that does these sort of things.</a>”"

      - text: "“These sort of things” includes the regularized sweeping up of information on multiple levels of transaction in corporate and governmental institutions, both voluntarily and unwittingly. A giant vacuum cleaner that collects all possible information, all possible dirt, and keeps it in a giant freezer. PRISM, for example, gathers communications from several major US internet companies, raising new questions. Taken together, these measures have led to this transaction of data becoming the norm rather than the exception. If you’re not familiar with the history of domestic spying, especially from 2001 onward, there’s a really detailed <a href='https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying/timeline' target='_blank'>timeline</a> of what actually happened published by the Electronic Freedom Foundation. "

      - text: "I’m tempted to say that this control of personal information is new, but we know from the history of computing that cryptography and surveillance were central aims in the development of computers. These ideas remind us of George Orwell’s <span class = 'italic'>1984</span>, a world where there is one giant corporate state and no sense of privacy. However, our lived experience may be closer to <span class = 'italic'>Brave New World</span>, a novel by Aldous Huxley. Compared to the Orwellian dystopia, the <span class = 'italic'>Brave New World</span> is a happy place. There is material abundance, music that never stops and a psychedelic substance called Soma that everyone takes to feel happy. It’s a space without real feeling or critical thinking. But underneath the seamless neatness, there are tightly controlled codes of behavior enforced through involuntary participation in mutual surveillance. There’s much more we can discuss concerning current government surveillance and its relationship to a wider global politics. "

  - title: "Discussion"
    paragraphs:
      - text: "Taeyoon: Francis, we were just talking about this before class. Would you like to share some thoughts?"
      - text: "Francis: I think a lot about this transition to a self-governing or self-regulation of behaviors, as if we are always being watched. This happened to me personally. I lived in China for a little bit where there is a lot of government surveillance – probably more than there is here. I remember every time I wrote an email or something, in the back of my mind I would wonder if I’m saying anything that could get me in trouble. So even if they weren’t watching me, the effects were still there."
      - text: "The other thing I mentioned was how contemporary surveillance can dissociate behaviors from the time period that they occur. For example, let’s say you do something that’s considered fine to do today. If it’s decided in the future that this act is unlawful, they could summon that particular data and use it against you in a totally different time."
      - text: "Taeyoon: Can I add something? We also talked about how it’s a privilege to say “I have nothing to hide.” One can say such thing only when they are in a socially and financially privileged place. Normalizing an assumption that one has ‘nothing to hide’ may cost the safety and dignity of others who are closer to risk. By enforcing this kind of transparency Eric Schmidt alludes to, you are actually oppressing another person."
      - text: "Francis: Absolutely. One more important point regarding surveillance relates to how pattern recognition, like AI and stuff, can impact what we might call precursor behaviors, or the actions that can lead to a person becoming under suspect. This happens all the time in China. China doesn’t want people politically organizing and protesting, right? So the behaviors that lead up to that are also suspect. So if you start talking in large groups on chat platforms, then they shut these down. Their thing with memes, apparently, is if they get transferred enough times they shut them off too because they don’t want the idea to propagate too far. So it keeps coming back to the precursor behaviors that lead to the actions they want to prevent, which increasingly also become illegal in a de facto sense of the matter."
      - text: "Taeyoon: Right, surveillance takes form in different ways. I am particularly interested in how this condition of surveillance affects the Average Joe or the Average Taeyoon."
      - text: "Francis: I like that you brought up <span class='italic'>Brave New World</span> earlier because that’s what I had in the back of my mind reading Deleuze’s essay. At the beginning of the piece, he talks about how society is controlled in a way that is very antithetical to the top-down authoritarian version in Orwell’s <span class = 'italic'>1984</span>. He was writing that around the time that <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner' target='_open'>B.F. Skinner</a> was doing his operant conditioning experiments on pigeons, training pigeons to do certain things so that they get food. He called that experiment “behavior shaping.” In this brave new society, some people live these really luxurious lives but in another hidden part of the world, in the tropics, there are people doing all the hard work. The way he sort of works through that problem in the story is that from birth they’re conditioned to want to do that kind of work in the tropics. I think that is the most important point about this society of control. It’s not about the person who is your boss telling you what to do or making you do something, because they can make you want to do it. So it’s all about shaping your desires so that they conform to their own ends."
