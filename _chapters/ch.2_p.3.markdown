      - text: "One of the first people to discover the neuron was Ramón y Cajal. In his drawings of a brain neuron, Cajal demonstrated his unique technique of using silver to trace the cell membranes. He used a microscope and traced what he saw onto a piece of paper. His attempt of ‘cartographing’ the connection between the synapses is visible in his drawing. By viewing this picture, <a href='https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/6b/5a/6f/6b5a6f3ff840593688cedd4f735631ee.jpg'>one can imagine Cajal in his makeshift lab</a>, tracing the synaptic modulation, trying to understand how brain works."

      - text: "Inside of our brains, in the smallest spaces between neurons, there are synapses. When an action potential activates the neuron, a signal that travels through the synapse and releases neurotransmitters. This movement of contraction and expansion in the synaptic gap contributes to transmitting a ‘message’. And when there’s a stimulation, the connections between neurons change with lighting fast speed. Repeated experiences strengthen associations between certain parts of the brain, thus creating long term memory.  "

      - text: "The connections in the brain are not indexed and organized in a static format. One neuron can be connected to different places and can be activated by different cues. When we use language, we activate different parts of the brain. For example, when we say ‘apple’, the parts of our brain associated with memory, language, taste, sight, smell and experience may be activated. The connections function as filters and other times as amplifiers, through many layers of abstractions. Observing all this, Catherine Malabou, a neuroscientist and a philosopher, makes this broader point: "

      - text: "<span class='blockquote'>Our brain is plastic, and we do not know it. We are completely ignorant of this dynamic, this organization, and this structure… Meanwhile, plasticity directly contradicts rigidity. It is its exact antonym. In ordinary speech, it designates suppleness, a faculty for adaptation, the ability to evolve. <span class='citation-num'>15</span></span>"

      - text: "In its dynamic suppleness and adaptability, the brain demonstrates the quality of <span class='italic'>plasticity</span>. This refers to the incredible changeability of the synapses, the small gaps between the neurons, in response to stimuli. It refers to how neurons and neural connections can receive form and give form to alter their collective structure and function. <span class='italic'>Plasticity</span> is differentiated from <span class='italic'>rigidity</span>, which means to become immobile or static. "

      - text: "This being the case, Malabou asks ‘what we should we do with our brain?’ I think this is a great question. The question is not how we should <span class='italic'>use</span> our brain, but how can we <span class='italic'>occupy</span> the brain? It is one organ that we really don’t understand but completely rely on every second of our existence. We may be better positioned to see the implications of brain plasticity by first considering the notion of <span class='italic'>plasticity</span> more broadly."

      - text: "<span class='blockquote'>The concept of plasticity has an aesthetic dimension (sculpture, malleability), just as much as an ethical one (solicitude, treatment, help, repair, rescue) and a political one (responsibility in the double movement of the receiving and the giving for form). <span class='citation-num'>16</span></span>"
        citation:
        - text:"Malabou, 30"

      - text: "Malabou’s wide-ranging application of <span class='italic'>plasticity</span>as receiving and giving form offers an alternative framework for thinking about the social and political realms we inhabit. This is where we begin to see some connections between plasticity as manifest in our brains and in our shared lives. In particular, it sheds a light on how our complicity, or participation, in the dominant world systems of capitalism requires us to operate within the counter-paradigm of flexibility."

      - text: "<span class='italic'>Flexibility</span> is a particularly relevant notion that many people who’ve worked as freelancers can relate to. It’s the ability to be everything and do everything on demand. One is asked to be flexible in the workplace, in relationships and in their relationship with the world. The word (flexibility) is tied to ‘employability.’ We are asked to be so flexible in our everyday life; we are asked to be so many things at the same time. If flexibile life is that of exploitation and innovation, plastic life is that of empowerment and invention. We can also ask if our being ‘flexible’ worsens the complex entanglement of exploitation and alienation. "    
        
      - text: " Being plastic means one can resist the normalizing forces of capitalism and create alternatives, while also perceiving the world with humility and presence. But how can we stay informed and mindful about our existence? To view the entire brain system as one of plasticity leads to ideas of a more progressive relationship between humans, computers and the world. It begins by remembering (giving form) and forgetting (receiving form) in lived reality. This can mean a lot of things. Being more conscious of the temporal nature of computer memory; not obsessing over the impermanence of memory; being more engaged with the present. Accepting the inevitable loss of data with grace. Malabou wants to shake us from our stupor and convey the power of give and take, of plasticity:"

      - text: "<span class='blockquote'>We persist in thinking of the brain as a centralized, rigidified, mechanical organization, and of the mechanical itself as a brain reduced to the work of calculation. Perhaps, as I have said, this is because plasticity is precisely the form of our world and because we are so immersed in it, so constituted by it, that we experience it without either thinking it or being conscious of it. We do this to such an extent that we no longer see that it structures our lives and sketches a certain portrait of power. We find here the poetical and aesthetic force that is the fundamental, organizing attribute of plasticity: its power to configure the world. <span class='citation-num'>17</span></span>"

      - text: "Is it possible to configure the world through computation? <span class='italic'>I’d answer yes, since computers are essentially a human invention</span>. Recall that Funes, like computers, had the curse of not forgetting and was rigid with memories such that he could not make or change his world. Can we combine our plasticity with the rigidities of computers to configure the world around us, specifically, by imagining poetic use of computer memory? Poetic computation can be a way of organizing digital memory, and thus configuring the world, for the way a set of information is configured is as important as the information itself.   "

      - text: "<span class='blockquote'> 1. All memory is physical, [so] information is material</span>"
      - text: "<span class='blockquote'>2.All memory is finite, [so] information is ephemeral</span>"

      - text: "This lecture was a two-fold mash up of a critique of the Memex and an exploration of the concept of plasticity. I’d like to collect these disparate ideas back into aesthetic questions regarding computation. "

      - text: "The computer is a giant memory machine. When we use the computer, we are, in essence, making memories of our perception, experience and thoughts. Computer memory is physical, even at the level of signals inside of digital electronics. But contrary to Bush’s vision, the computer is an unreliable memory machine. As much as the computer remembers, it tends to forget as well, just not in the ways we want. Indeed, Chun writes that memory always disappears, whether digital or physical: "

      - text: "<span class='blockquote'>If computer memory is like anything, it is like erasable writing; but, if a penciled word can be erased because graphite is soft, a computer’s memory can be rewritten because its surface constantly fades.<span class='citation-num'>18</span></span>"

        - text:" Wendy Chun, 'The Enduring Ephemeral, or the Future is a Memory,' ADD PAGE NUMBER"

      - text: "Computer memory (data) is a thing, an object. And it is subject to the same constraints of all physical objects. All computer memory is just electrical charges held momentarily in a complex weave of circuits. And all computer memory is stored on a physical hard disk or in the cloud, which also involves physical hardware. As Mimi Onuoha points out, “All data, from dutiful Facebook likes to iCloud selfies to every secret NSA database, is stored on a physical device somewhere.'<span class='citation-num'>19</span>"

      - text: "Computer memory is often flawed and recalcitrant in that what you want to be permanent gets lost and what's supposed to be temporary sticks around forever. Because backups are not always reliable, and the possibility of losing data is always present, corporations have developed many solutions designed to produce profit (and some might argue to hold data hostage) to try to preserve one’s computer memory. In the final analysis, though, the life and death of data is often beyond our own control<span class='citation-num'>20</span>  "
        citations: 
          - text: 'To try to assert our control over the permanent trace of our activity online, activists claim the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">Right to be forgotten</a>.” It essentially claims that as free individuals, we should have the right to be forgotten through the agency of deciding how our computer memory will be shared online after our death, if at all.'

      - text: "So instead of fixating on the durability of digital data, let’s focus on the complexities of computer memory, its fragility and its resilience, through an artistic vision. The poetic computation is about challenging what is possible within the constraints of computation. Instead of seeking more efficient ways of preserving computer memory, more interesting and urgent questions await us."

      - text: "What makes some computer memory more meaningful to us? How does computation affect the way we remember the past, live in the present and project the future? How can we use computation as a tool to understand how we think and remember? What are the emotional resonances with certain types of computer memory? What is the poetry that can be written through computer memory? What are the ethical responsibilities of creating computer memory? "
