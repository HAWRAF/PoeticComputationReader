      - text: "Engelbart then demonstrates a dynamic map of his route from work to home with  various stops he needs to make, including the grocery store and library. When he points at the library with his mouse, it links to information about books that are overdue. And when he points at the drugstore, it links to items to pick up there. Prior to Engelbart, there wasn’t this sense in the mainstream imagination of the screen as a space with an X-Y axis that one could navigate as if it were a real map."

      - text: "What may seem so familiar now were radical functionalities at that time<span class='citation-num'>8</span>. Engelbart’s interpretation of “trails” with hot linked connections allowed for hierarchical organization as well as dynamic engagement with the screen (via map-like structures). This demo had a decisive influence on how future generations approached computer memory, namely, using hierarchy as the basic organizing principle. To this day, we continue to think of computer memory as data residing in files and folders, folders inside of folders, which is evident in the visual metaphor of manila folders in contemporary operating systems.

      - text: "Later on, movies such as <span class='italic'>Minority Report (2002)</span> continue to demonstrate a version of “trails” as envisioned by Bush. In this famous scene, the protagonist Tom Cruise navigates a 3D interface of densely linked information in search of evidence for preemptive policing. In the scene, the “trails” are visualized literally as a timeline and clusters of memory, rendered as hazy videos in first-person perspective. The scene extends Bush’s vision of a computer as a container for knowledge that can be accessed as needed; also, it further propagates in the popular imagination, the idea that computers can ‘hold’ information about our lives, reliably and permanently.<span class='citation-num'>9</span>."
        citations:
          - text: "Minority Report tells a disturbingly familiar tale of a dystopian future that centers on patriarchal protagonists and their quest for a control so complete that even memory (and the temporality embedded therein) is subject to their actions. This kind of narrative appeals to Hollywood film audiences because of their fixation with technology (what can’t technology do?) and the fantasy that technology can grant ultimate mastery over their own bodies, those around them, and the shape of their lives. These kinds of narratives are common in technology product demos, like Apple product launches, where the general message is how the new device will empower you. Whether in the realm of consumerism or in the more fantastic (sci-fi) iterations of entertainment, these narratives shape how we think about and use technology products. "

      - text: "To this day, many contemporary technologies have a direct connection to the Memex machine as its basic principle of “trails” are integrated into smartphones, self tracking devices and social media. We’ve learned to harness the computational power of these applications and devices to help us remember and communicate. However, the Memex presented only one vision of computers and is not without its shortcomings.<span class='citation-num'>10</span>"
        citations: 
          - text: "The Memex presents the vision of a computer as an encyclopedia of knowledge, as a giant archive machine. However, other visions were possible such as computers as a tool for communication and for automation (cybernetics)."

      - text: "Bush invented the Memex to aid humans who are incapable of indexing large quantities of information. However, in designing the means for humans to access information efficiently, Bush promoted a simplified vision of how human memory operates. He assumed that the act of <span class='italic'>accessing</a> the missing information was commensurate with <span class='italic'>understanding</a> it. Wendy Chun critiques this in her essay, “The Enduring Ephemeral, or the Future Is a Memory”"

      - text: "<span class='blockquote'>In Bush’s writing, and in prognoses for the information revolution more generally, there is no difference between access to and understanding the record, between what would be called, perhaps symptomatically, machine reading and human reading and comprehension, between information and argument. The difficulty supposedly lies in selecting the data, not in reading it, for it is assumed that reading is a trivial act, a simple comprehension of the record’s content. Once the proper record is selected, there is no misreading, no misunderstanding, only transparent information.<span class='citation-num'>11</span></span>"

          - text: "Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, “The Enduring Ephemeral, or the Future is a Memory,” Critical Inquiry 35 (Autumn 2008)."

      - text: "Chun argues that accessing some information does not necessarily mean understanding it. Reading does not necessarily lead to comprehension. And most importantly, information is useless without an argument to provide context to make it meaningful. "

      - text: "<span class='blockquote'>Reading ≠ Comprehension </span>"

      - text: "<span class='blockquote'>Information ≠ Argument</span>"

      - text: "Unlike Bush, Chun does not take understanding for granted because as humans, understanding is always relational, always contextual. We remember certain information by finding arguments around it, creating contexts for comprehension, and through repetition, we come to understand the information. Bush, on the other hand, makes a deterministic assumption about how the human brain operates:"

      - text: "<span class='blockquote'>In the outside world, all forms of intelligence whether of sound or sight, have been reduced to the form of varying currents in an electric circuit in order that they may be transmitted. Inside the human frame exactly the same sort of process occurs.<span class='citation-num'>12</span></span>"

          - text: "<span class='citation-num'>8</span> Vannevar Bush, “As We May Think."          

      - text: "In Bush’s narrative, he reduces all manifestations of intelligence (memory of some kind) to currents in an electrical circuit (storage of some kind), such that the ‘significance’ of these currents should be accessible and apparent. While this may be true to a degree for computers, this does not apply to the human brain.<span class='citation-num'>13</span></span>"
        citations:
          -text: "In maintaining that humans and computers access and process information differently, it seems Chun would agree that Bush is misled in conflating human memory and storage with that of computers."

      - text: "This is in large part because human brains have the characteristic of ‘plasticity,’ and computers, while they can imitate plasticity, operate according to a more rigid series of instructions. Human memory is always associative and contextual, while computer memory is often indexical and categorical. I will explore these differences in the next two sections—first, with the concept of forgetting, and second, through the concept of plasticity."

      - text: "Jorge Luis Borges wrote “Funes the Memorious,” a story about meeting a man who had a terrible accident, and as a side effect, could remember everything.<span class='citation-num'>14</span> For a time this man was considered a genius because of his incredible long term memory. However, as time passed, he could not live his life because his mind was totally occupied by memories. His memory was driving him insane. For him to recall one day, it took another whole day because he would remember every detail of every experience. In a sense, he was cursed with an inability to forget. When Borges returns to him years later, he finds a man that has been defeated by the destructive nature of total memory. Because of it, he could not live or sleep, and it ended up destroying him. "
        citations: 
          - text: "<span class='citation-num'>9</span> Jorge Luis Borges, 'Funes the Memorious,' trans. by Anthony Kerrigan (New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1962)."

      - text: "We find a less ominous vision of this capacity to remember all things for all time in Bush’s Memex, which is essentially a memory machine. Bush suggested the information (records) in the Memex could attain a permanency not possible before, and that if it were stored on disk formats in an accessible way, we would be saved from the burden of having to remember since computers would do the labor. He further implied that attaining such control over information could give humans control over the environment and even the future."

      - text: "Partly due to Bush’s outsized influence, some version of the Funes story has become a reality wherein computers have become our ‘external brain’ which remembers and archives everything. Much of the compilation of our data is now automated and not really within our control. However, we’re haunted by traces of an infinite and ever growing past.  "

      - text: "Whether in Bush’s time, Borges’s time, or our own, the assumption is that forgetting (or losing memory) is always the problem, but the story of “Funes the Memorious” continues to remind us that forgetting is necessary. Forgetting is as important as remembering. Forgetting enables us to remember. If we cannot forget, we may soon run out of capacity to remember as well as the ability to experience the world through sensory stimulations. Forgetting is a human experience of existing in the world. Although much technology, especially since the Memex, has focused on enhancing human ability to remember, perhaps we need to secure our ability to forget. Perhaps this ability to forget is not our flaw, but our bliss; that which essentially makes us human."

      - text: "Perhaps we are starting to get a sense of what is at stake in the comparisons made between the computer and brain. It’s important to resist overstating the similarities between the way the brain and computer work because we may mistakenly project lack where there is none, or project a desire for some kind of totality that has no real applications in our life. We will further explore those themes in a future lecture on forgetting in relation to the archive. For now, I turn to an essential and distinguishing characteristic of the human brain."
