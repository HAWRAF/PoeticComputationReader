  - title: "Politics: What technology wants and what we want?"
    paragraphs:
      - text: I want to ask about the sense of ethics in relation to technological progress. Development of technology is always intertwined with ethical responsibilities. Employing engineering concepts and tools for creative expression also come with ethical responsibilities. The history of computing is not only about the wonders, the genius and spectacles. In fact, early computers were a byproduct of operations research for the war. It’s important to understand computers were developed in different parts of the world at the same time. In the U.S., the most significant development involved the Manhattan project, which <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Laboratories_Building_(Manhattan)">took place here </a> (at 155 Bank St, NYC, current home of SFPC) and at various research universities and government research facilities.
      - text: I want to return to a figure I introduced earlier, John Von Neumann, whose name is still credited as the architect of the Central Processing Units found in most contemporary computers. He was a highly celebrated engineer, often considered as one of the fathers of modern computing. In my perspective, he was a deeply problematic man. He may have been a scientific prodigy, but he was also a technocrat (one who tries to use technology to govern people) who unquestionably devoted his genius toward the invention of war machines. When Von Neumann worked for the government on major military assignments during and after WWII, he garnered a tremendous amount of power, especially when it came to the atomic bomb. In debating the target, Von Neumann tried to insist on Kyoto instead of Hiroshima, reasoning that its greater population and history would maximize the material and symbolic impact of atomic destruction.<span class="citation-num">7</span> This anecdote suggests he had very little empathy for humans and culture. His belief in technology and his self-righteousness along with many other men involved in the war, created the conditions for Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The atomic bombing was arguably one of the most horrific thing anyone has ever done, to kill so many people, so many innocent bystanders. To this day, I’m surprised the catastrophe isn’t talked about as much in the history of computing, especially when discussing operations research. People discuss machines that kill but don’t talk about those who are killed or the profound coyness of defense contractors. All computational technology in its infancy was enlisted in the service of war.

      - text: 'As artists working with technology, it’s possible to distance ourselves from the narratives of progress and spectacle. However, we must be cautious of technology. Technology works towards a certain kind of art. In his famous essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” Walter Benjamin directly addressed the Futurists, a group of Italian avant garde artists led by Marinetti. The Futurists and their obscure inventions are often considered early pioneers of new media artists because they actively used modern technology such as sound and films. The Futurists were vocal supporters of Italian Fascists like Mussolini, and identified as one of them. They often praised the war as <span class="italic">the</span> ultimate form of beauty. In a sense, they were trying to reinvent the world through war. Benjamin quotes the Futurist Manifesto and provides his commentary.'

            caption: "Intonarumori by Luigi Russolo: Via @ <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intonarumori'>Wikipedia</a>"      
      - text:  <span class="blockquote">‘For twenty-seven years we Futurists have rebelled against the branding of war as anti-aesthetic ... Accordingly we state:... War is beautiful because it establishes man’s dominion over the subjugated machinery by means of gas masks, terrifying megaphones, flame throwers, and small tanks. War is beautiful because it initiates the dreamt-of metalization of the human body. War is beautiful because it enriches a flowering meadow with the fiery orchids of machine guns. War is beautiful because it combines the gunfire, the cannonades, the cease-fire, the scents, and the stench of putrefaction into a symphony. War is beautiful because it creates new architecture, like that of the big tanks, the geometrical formation flights, the smoke spirals from burning villages, and many others ... Poets and artists of Futurism! ... remember these principles of an aesthetics of war so that your struggle for a new literature and a new graphic art ... may be illumined by them!’</span>
      - text: "<span class='blockquote'>This manifesto has the virtue of clarity. Its formulations deserve to be accepted by dialecticians. To the latter, the aesthetics of today’s war appears as follows: If the natural utilization of productive forces is impeded by the property system, the increase in technical devices, in speed, and in the sources of energy will press for an unnatural utilization, and this is found in war. The destructiveness of war furnishes proof that society has not been mature enough to incorporate technology as its organ, that technology has not been sufficiently developed to cope with the elemental forces of society.<span class='citation-num'>8</span></span>"

      - text: "Reading the Futurist Manifesto is scary. I have a similarly uneasy feeling when I look at some new media artwork that echoes the technocratic agenda, or art that celebrates technical possibilities without careful consideration of the context.  Technology is biased towards certain forms of art; it is not neutral. I’d like to extend my argument to critique technocracy as well as ‘technological solutionism,’ a belief that technology will save us from our problems. Benjamin’s comment suggests progress in technology leads to a surplus of material resources but not necessarily society’s readiness to take care of the wealth and the people. Instead, society turns to abusing the products of progress into it’s own destruction. Technology does not save us. Instead, we need to save history from technology's tendency towards demise.

    paragraphs:
      - text: "Finally, I’d like to ask a question. As artists, are we working with technology because it is a medium available us? or are we contributing to a form of technocracy, wittingly or unwittingly? It is no surprise that many new media artists work for corporations. It is no surprise that a lot engineers cultivate creative technology work for DARPA.<span class='citation-num'>9</span> It’s no surprise that open source initiatives may have unintended consequences, or wielded in the service of malevolent aims. It’s no surprise that a lot of the push toward transparency and openness (in social network) can lead to invasion of privacy. This field that we contribute to is deeply complex and contains issues and unknown factors. How can we create work that challenges the present moment? How can our work contribute to a future that doesn’t repeat the mistakes from the past? How can we use technology for subversive purposes? I return to Walter Benjamin’s <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theses_on_the_Philosophy_of_History' target='_blank'>Theses on the philosophy of history</a> for advice:"

      - text: "<span class='blockquote'>A Klee painting named Angelus Novus shows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress. <span class='citation-num'>10</span></span>"

      - text: "When Walter Benjamin wrote “This storm is what we call progress,” he was referring to the idea of perpetual ‘progress’ in Historical Materialism and the tendency to equate progress with the future. This ‘storm’ is analogous to unexamined innovation and reformation which can take the form of perpetual war. Perhaps this last sentence, “this storm is what we call progress,” asks us to invert the common perspective that we take responsibility for the past and project alternatives for the future. Instead, we may consider looking at the present with responsibility for the future and to take care of the present by addressing the past."
      - text: "I believe our work as artists can be writing a counter-narrative to mainstream media and history governed by capitalism. As artists and creative practitioners, I believe we can create a counter-narrative to reanimate unheard voices from history. Such work can be the foundation for a counter-archive, an archive that brings truth to light."
      - text: "Making electronic circuits and coding has a sense of jouissance. It’s very liberating to work with these materials in expressive manners. The kind of joy is similar to live drawing on a wall, without the boundaries, free drawing in the air. It’s a chance to transgress the discipline, the constraints within the medium, the particular complexities that it inhabits. If our art work becomes political praxis, we have a chance to write a counter-narrative to the mainstream narrative. Our work has the potential to become an independent inquiry into creating the future we want."
